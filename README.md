## General Information
- An application written in JavaScript to consolidate knowledge from the course. The project was written based on ECMAScript 6 standards. The game contains 10 sentences to guess and the same number of hints. While playing, the time counts down and the number of guessed sentences is counted, so you can see your results at the end.
- In the future, I would like to implement a possibility to save results. A kind of record board thanks to which you will be able to track your progress. In addition, I am thinking about two things... Either I will give the user the opportunity to add their own sentences or I will add an API, so that the user will be able to guess sentences that he has not seen before (which, unfortunately, would happen in the first case).


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ / _I will work on it_.


## Room for Improvement

To do:
- Record Board
- Possibility to add your own sentences or API that add it itself.
